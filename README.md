# Book Tracker App

# By Ashley Capace and Evin Lerouge

## We used MongoDB, Express, React, and Node to create this app. This app was created to help the user keep track of the books that they have read and have not read.

## The user can create and submit a book, edit the book they have already in, delete a book, and update the book to "read" once they have read the book, and then it will move to the bottom of the page.
